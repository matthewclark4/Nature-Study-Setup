# Nature-Study-Setup
Code to run for tutorial on setting up data plants. This video gives an idea of how it works. https://vimeo.com/421002507

Nature Study is a project that explores the benefits of engaging with environmental and civic issues in the local area. Generative visuals are created with various plants which are then presented in a publication.

To create the visuals, electrode pads were placed on the leaves which measure the electrical activity in the plant using Arduino. This data was then visualised using code in Processing. This guide will hopefully show you how to set it up yourself. Much of the initial setup was based on Robbie Barrat's guide which you can find here https://github.com/robbiebarrat/plant-art
